<h1>Todo</h1>
<p>This example demonstrates a simple Todo with Jersey on the backend and AngularJs on the frontend.</p>
<p>Note: There is no validation on the frontend side, every error displayed is recognized on the backend.</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The mapping of the URI path space is presented in the following table:</p>
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>URI path</th>
        <th>Resource class</th>
        <th>HTTP methods</th>
        <th>Allowed values</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>/api/todo</td>
        <td>TodoResource</td>
        <td>GET, POST, DELETE</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>/api/todo/{id}</td>
        <td>TodoResource</td>
        <td>GET, DELETE, PUT</td>
        <td>id - positive number</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>/api/todo/search/{searchType}?q={searchValue}</td>
        <td>SearchResource</td>
        <td>GET</td>
        <td>searchType - (title|body|done)<br/>searchValue - non empty string</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Application is configured by using web.xml, which registers
    <a href="https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/nonav/2.0/apidocs/javax/ws/rs/core/Application.html">javax.ws.rs.core.Application</a> descendant to get
    classes and singletons from it (see class MyApplication). Bean Validation annotations are present on resource classes (see todoResource, SearchResource)
    as well as on the domain class (see todo).</p>
<p>
    When <code>curl</code> (see examples below) is used for sending requests to the server, one can see how to affect the media type of returned validation errors (if any).
    <br/>
    Allowed media types for validation errors entities are: "text/plain"/"text/html" or "application/json"/"application/xml" (appropriate provider has to be registered to transform errors into JSON/XML)
    <br/>
    Note: <code>jersey.config.beanValidation.enableOutputValidationErrorEntity.server</code> init parameter (<code>web.xml</code>) has to be enabled to let Jersey know
    that it should send validation errors as a Response entities (this behavior if disabled by default).
</p>

<h2>Running the Example</h2>
<p>Run the example as follows:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
mvn clean package jetty:run</pre></blockquote>
<p>This deploys current example using Jetty. You can access the application at <a href="http://localhost:8080/todo">http://localhost:8080/todo</a>
</p>
<p>You can access resources of this application also using curl:</p>
<blockquote><code>curl -X POST --data '{"title":"hi","body":"text body", "done":false}'  -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/bean-validation-webapp/api/todo

curl -X PUT --data '{"title":"hi2","id":1, "body":"text body", "done":false}'  -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/bean-validation-webapp/api/todo/1

curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/bean-validation-webapp/api/todo

curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/bean-validation-webapp/api/todo/1
</code></blockquote>
